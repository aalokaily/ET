Install the following library
https://github.com/ptrus/suffix-trees 

Then edit ./suffix_trees/STree.py as the following:

- comment the following line, line 249, by appending "#" at the beginning of the line. This will allow setting attributes more freely.
__slots__ = ['_suffix_link', 'transition_links', 'idx', 'depth', 'parent', 'generalized_idxs']

- In some procedure, we hashed suffix tree internal nodes, so we used only the combination of node index and node depth to identify uniqually the node instaed of the original long identifcation 
of the nodes given by the library. Shorter ideintifcation will use less space and speed up the looku[p process for the hashed nodes. So replace the following two lines in 
./suffix_trees/STree.py (which are line 264 and 265) 

return ("SNode: idx:" + str(self.idx) + " depth:" + str(self.depth) +
                " transitons:" + str(list(self.transition_links.keys())))

with the line 

return (str(self.idx) + "-" + str(self.depth))

Running the tool:
The tool was tested on DNA sequences (fasta format). As a prepration process for the input data, remove headers and newlines from the fasta file.
